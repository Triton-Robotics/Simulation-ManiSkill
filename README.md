# Keyboard controls

Launch using

```bash
ros2 run sim_node keyboard_controls
```

### primary robot

we do not use WASD because that conflicts with the camera controls of the human GUI.

```
t = forward
f = left 
g = backward
h = right
r = counterclockwise rotation
y = clockwise rotation
```

### secondary robot

```
i = forward
j = left
k = backward
l = right


5 = stop rotation
4 = 25% counterclockwise rotation
3 = 50% counterclockwise rotation
2 = 75% counterclockwise rotation
1 = 100% counterclockwise rotation
6 = 25% clockwise rotation
7 = 50% clockwise rotation
8 = 75% clockwise rotation
